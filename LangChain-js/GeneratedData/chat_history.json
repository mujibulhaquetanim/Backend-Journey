It's commonly used to prepare complex data structures for storage or transmission. The basic syntax is `JSON.stringify(value[, replacer[, space]])`, where `value` is the JavaScript object to stringify, `replacer` is used to alter the stringification process, and `space` is used for pretty-printing the output.",

For example, `{\"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 30}`.\n\nA string, in general, is a sequence of characters, not necessarily formatted to represent data structures. For example, `\"Hello, world!\"`.\n\nIn summary, JSON strings are a specific type of string used to encode and transmit data, while strings can be any sequence of characters.",
