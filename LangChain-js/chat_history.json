This is useful for:\n\n1. **Storing Data**: Saving data in a format that can be easily stored in cookies, local storage, or sent to a server.\n2. **Data Transmission**: Converting objects into strings for transmission over a network in web applications.\n3. **Compatibility**: Ensuring data can be parsed and used by systems that support JSON format."

    "content": "The JSON format is often used with the `fs` module to store data in a file because it is a lightweight, text-based format that is easy to read and write. Here are the key reasons:\n\n1. **Readability**: JSON is human-readable, making it easier to debug and manage.\n2. **Standardization**: It is a standard format that can be easily parsed and used across different programming languages.\n3. **Simplicity**: JSON supports basic data structures like objects and arrays, making it straightforward to serialize and deserialize JavaScript objects.\n\nFor example, you can convert an object to a JSON string and write it to a file using:\n```javascript\nconst fs = require('fs');\nconst data = { name: 'John', age: 30 };\nfs.writeFileSync('data.json', JSON.stringify(data));\n```\nThis makes it simple to persist and retrieve the data later."
