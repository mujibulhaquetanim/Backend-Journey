#File streaming:
Video summary [00:00:00][^1^][1] - [00:09:10][^2^][2]:

Part 1 of the video talks about the concept and use of streams in Node.js. It explains how streams can help with memory efficiency and performance when reading and writing large files. It also shows an example of how to create a read stream and pipe it to the response object.

**Highlights**:
+ [00:00:05][^3^][3] **The problem of reading large files without streams**
