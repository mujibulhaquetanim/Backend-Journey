### Giving alternative names to the fields:
 without usernameField and passwordField, use username and password in the body instead of email and password. but if you want to give a different name for username and password, use the values of usernameField and passwordField. i.e. emailField and passwordField.

#### alternative approaches to handle custom user types with Passport without directly extending the Express.User interface. Let's explore a few options:

1. Type Assertion

   You can use type assertion to tell TypeScript that the user object is of your custom type:

   ```typescript
   passport.serializeUser((user, done) => {
     done(null, (user as User).id);
   });

   passport.deserializeUser((id, done) => {
     // ...
     done(null, findUser as User);
   });
   ```

   This approach is simple but doesn't provide compile-time checks for the user object structure.

2. Generic Types

   Passport allows you to specify a custom user type using generics:

   ```typescript
   import passport from 'passport';
   import { Strategy as LocalStrategy } from 'passport-local';

   declare module 'passport' {
     interface Authenticator<InitializeRet = any, AuthenticateRet = any, AuthorizeRet = AuthenticateRet> {
       use(strategy: Strategy<User>): this;
       serializeUser<TUser = User, TID = number>(fn: (user: TUser, done: (err: any, id?: TID) => void) => void): void;
       deserializeUser<TID = number, TUser = User>(fn: (id: TID, done: (err: any, user?: TUser) => void) => void): void;
     }
   }

   // Your code here
   ```

   This method provides better type safety but requires more setup.

3. Separate User Types

   You can create separate types for your application and for Passport:

   ```typescript
   interface AppUser {
     id: number;
     name?: string;
     email: string;
     password: string;
     isAdmin?: boolean;
   }

   interface PassportUser {
     id: number;
     email: string;
   }

   passport.serializeUser((user: AppUser, done) => {
     const passportUser: PassportUser = { id: user.id, email: user.email };
     done(null, passportUser);
   });

   passport.deserializeUser((serializedUser: PassportUser, done) => {
     // Find full user based on serializedUser
     // ...
   });
   ```

   This approach keeps your types separate and explicit, but requires more manual mapping.

4. Custom Passport Instance

   Create a custom Passport instance with your user type:

   ```typescript
   import passportModule from 'passport';

   const passport = new passportModule.Passport();

   export interface CustomUser {
     id: number;
     name?: string;
     email: string;
     password: string;
     isAdmin?: boolean;
   }

   passport.serializeUser<CustomUser>((user, done) => {
     done(null, user.id);
   });

   passport.deserializeUser<number, CustomUser>((id, done) => {
     // ...
   });
   ```

   This method provides good type safety and keeps your custom types isolated.

Each of these approaches has its pros and cons:

- Type assertion is simple but less type-safe.
- Generic types provide good type safety but require more setup.
- Separate user types are explicit but require more manual work.
- A custom Passport instance provides good isolation and type safety.

The best choice depends on your specific needs, the complexity of your project, and your team's preferences. The method you originally asked about (extending Express.User) is still a valid and commonly used approach, especially for larger projects where you want to ensure type consistency across the entire application.
